# Fakeymon2

This iteration of Fakeymon is a large renovation of my original Fakeymon game developed back in 2018.
It is much cleaner, easier to understand, and overall an optimized version with very few bugs (see [bugs.txt](https://github.com/paulkia/Fakeymon2/blob/master/bugs.txt)). (Feel free to let me know if anything is wrong with the project at paulkarmel@outlook.com!)

Whereas the original Fakeymon project was designed and written over the course of several months, Fakeymon2 took about 1.5 weeks to create from scratch. However, much of the design is the same as its original.

To play the game, all you need to download is "Fakeymon.jar" and the "data/" directory, and these must be together in the same directory to function properly. The "src/" directory is included for anyone interested in the game's source code.

### Features

Here's what the game looks like when it boots up!

Here's a preview of the battle mechanics!

If you beat an enemy mon, it might join your team! This mechanic was inspired by Pokémon Mystery Dungeon's friend mechanic.

Every few battles, you can rest up at a Fakeymon center!

Make sure not to get caught if you try to steal something!

The game autosaves every time you reach the menu! You can easily load your game if you decide to close at some point. The data is stored with easy-to-read JSON in the data/saves directory.
